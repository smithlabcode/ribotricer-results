# Results and the scripts for benchmarking RiboCop with other methods for detecting actively translating ORFs from Ribo-seq data

The benchmark method used here are partially established by RiboTaper and RiboCode which relies on using profiles of expressed CCDS exons or genes from Ribo-seq data as true positives and those from RNA-seq data as true negatives to assess the performance of each method.
